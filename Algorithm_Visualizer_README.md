# 🧠 Algorithm Visualizer

> **Don't just read the algorithm. Watch it work.**

An interactive web-based Algorithm Visualizer built to make fundamental Computer Science algorithms easier to understand by turning their logic into animations.

The project focuses on a simple idea: instead of only looking at code, complexity formulas, or textbook diagrams, you can **see comparisons, swaps, searches, and graph traversal happen in real time.**

## ✨ What Can You Explore?

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) |

The bars change as the algorithm runs, making comparisons and swaps visible.

### 🔎 Searching

**Binary Search**

Watch the search range shrink as the algorithm repeatedly checks the middle of a sorted array.

- Best: O(1)
- Average: O(log n)
- Worst: O(log n)
- Space: O(1)

### 🕸️ Graph Traversal

**BFS — Breadth-First Search**

Explores nodes level by level using a queue.

**DFS — Depth-First Search**

Explores as far as possible along a path before backtracking.

For both:

- Time: O(V + E)
- Space: O(V)

Where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

## 🎮 How to Use It

The visualizer is designed around experimenting.

1. Choose an algorithm.
2. Generate an array or enter your own values.
3. Choose a visualization speed.
4. Press **Start**.
5. Pause whenever you want.
6. Use **Step** to understand the algorithm operation by operation.
7. Reset and try again.

For graph algorithms, watch the nodes change state as BFS or DFS explores the graph.

The idea is to encourage experimentation rather than simply displaying a final result.

## 🧩 What Is Actually Happening?

The visualization isn't replacing the algorithms with animations.

The algorithms themselves are implemented in JavaScript.

The visualizer observes important operations and represents them visually.

For example, a simplified Bubble Sort process looks like:

```text
[ 8, 3, 5, 1 ]

Compare 8 and 3
       ↓
     Swap
       ↓
[ 3, 8, 5, 1 ]

Compare 8 and 5
       ↓
     Swap
       ↓
[ 3, 5, 8, 1 ]

...continue...
```

Eventually:

```text
[ 1, 3, 5, 8 ]
```

The point is to understand **the process**, not just the answer.

---

## 🎨 Visualization States

The interface uses visual states to make the algorithm easier to follow.

Depending on the algorithm, elements/nodes can represent:

- **Unprocessed**
- **Currently being compared**
- **Selected**
- **Being swapped**
- **Visited**
- **Sorted**
- **Current search position**

Colors have a purpose: they communicate what the algorithm is doing rather than being purely decorative.

---

## 🧪 Example

Suppose the input is:

```text
8, 3, 6, 1, 9, 2
```

Selecting **Insertion Sort** allows you to watch the values gradually form a sorted section.

Instead of only seeing:

```text
[1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
```

you can see how each value is compared and inserted into its position.

That distinction is the main reason this project exists.

# 🛠️ Technologies

The project is intentionally built with a straightforward front-end stack:

- **HTML** — page structure
- **CSS** — layout and visual design
- **JavaScript** — algorithms, interaction and visualization
- **DOM APIs** — updating the interface

There is no backend or database because the project does not need one.

The algorithms are implemented directly rather than being provided by an external visualization library.

---

# 📁 Project Structure

The exact structure can vary as the project develops, but the code is organized around the main parts of the application.

```text
algorithm-visualizer/
│
├── index.html
│
├── css/
│   └── style.css
│
├── js/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── sorting.js
│   ├── searching.js
│   └── graph.js
│
├── assets/
│
└── README.md
```

The important idea is to keep the algorithm logic separate enough from the interface that the actual algorithms remain easy to read.

# 🚀 Run It Locally

You don't need a database, server, or complicated setup.

### Option 1 — Open directly

Download or clone the repository and open:

```text
index.html
```

in a modern browser.

### Option 2 — VS Code Live Server

For a smoother development experience:

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension.
3. Right-click `index.html`.
4. Select **Open with Live Server**.
5. The project will open in your browser.

---

# 🌐 Deploy It

Because this is a static front-end project, it can be deployed using services that host HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

## Option 1 — GitHub Pages

A good choice if you want your university application portfolio and source code in the same place.

### Steps

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Upload the project files.
3. Make sure `index.html` is in the correct location.
4. Open the repository's **Settings**.
5. Find **Pages**.
6. Under the deployment source, select the branch containing the project.
7. Save the settings.
8. GitHub will provide a public website address.

Your repository can then contain both:

```text
Source Code
    +
README
    +
Live Demo
```

This is useful for a university portfolio because someone can inspect the code and try the project without installing anything.

---

## Option 2 — Netlify

You can also deploy the static project through Netlify.

General process:

1. Create/sign into a Netlify account.
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. Select the Algorithm Visualizer repository.
4. Deploy the site.
5. Netlify provides a public URL.

No backend server is required for this project.

---

## Option 3 — Vercel

Vercel can also host the project.

General process:

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. Sign into Vercel.
3. Import the repository.
4. Deploy it.
5. Vercel generates a public URL.

For a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, no complicated backend configuration should be necessary.

# 📚 What I Learned

One of the main reasons for building this project was to understand algorithms more deeply.

While working on it, I practiced:

- Implementing algorithms instead of only reading them
- Working with arrays and loops
- Understanding how comparisons and swaps affect an array
- Understanding why Binary Search needs sorted data
- Seeing the difference between BFS and DFS
- Thinking about time and space complexity
- Connecting JavaScript logic with visual interface changes
- Breaking a larger project into smaller parts
- Designing an interface around an educational purpose

A major takeaway was that an algorithm can look very different when you actually watch its individual operations.

# 🔬 Why This Project?

Algorithms are often taught using:

```text
Code
+
Formula
+
Example
```

That works, but it can still be difficult to imagine what the computer is doing.

This project takes another approach:

```text
Algorithm
    ↓
Operations
    ↓
Visualization
    ↓
Understanding
```

The goal isn't to make algorithms look flashy.

The goal is to make their behavior easier to see.

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible future additions include:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search
- Heap Sort
- More graph structures
- Custom graph creation
- Algorithm comparison mode
- Step-by-step source-code highlighting
- Operation counters
- More detailed performance comparisons

These are ideas for future versions rather than requirements for the current project.

# ⚠️ Limitations

This is an educational visualization tool.

The visual execution adds extra work compared with running a normal algorithm, so the animation itself should not be treated as a precise benchmark of algorithm performance.

The complexity values describe the underlying algorithms, not the time taken by the browser to animate them.

---

# 🎯 Project Goal

The project has one main goal:

> **Make fundamental algorithms easier to understand by making their behavior visible.**

It was built as a learning project to strengthen my understanding of algorithms, programming fundamentals, and front-end development.
